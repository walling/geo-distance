Common JS module for calculating and converting Earth distances using correct
[great-circle distance formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance).


Installation
------------

```sh
npm install geo-distanc
```

```sh
yarn add geo-distanc
```
```


Notice
------

The lat/lon coordinates were flipped until v0.1.2. This is fixed in v0.2.0. Please be aware, when updating. [Discussion here](https://github.com/walling/geo-distance/issues/2).


Usage example
-------------

For JavaScripters:

    var Distance = require('geo-distance');

    console.log('' + Distance('50 km').human_readable('customary'));

	// https://www.latlong.net/place/oslo-norway-14195.html: Oslo, Norway, Latitude and longitude coordinates are: 59.911491, 10.757933
    var Oslo = {
      lat: 59.914,
      lon: 10.752
    };
    var Berlin = {
      lat: 52.523,
      lon: 13.412
    };
    var OsloToBerlin = Distance.between(Oslo, Berlin);

    console.log('' + OsloToBerlin.human_readable());
    if (OsloToBerlin > Distance('800 km')) {
      console.log('Nice journey!');
    }

For CoffeeScripters:

    Distance = require 'geo-distance'

    console.log "#{ Distance('50 km').human_readable 'customary' }"

    Oslo =
      lat: 59.914
      lon: 10.752
    Berlin =
      lat: 52.523
      lon: 13.412
    OsloToBerlin = Distance.between Oslo, Berlin

    console.log "#{ OsloToBerlin.human_readable() }"
    console.log 'Nice journey!' if OsloToBerlin > Distance '800 km'


Other modules
-------------

If you want to work with GeoJSON or maybe just want to calculate distance as a number (fx. kilometers or miles), it is possible to use the [@turf/distance](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/distance) npm module.
